This is a simple kotlin app that can draw algebraic fractals  
Written with Jetpack Compose  


To run this, just use `./gradlew run` in the repository folder (or `./gradlew.bat run` if you're on windows)  
You can make some alternations in source code to make the fractal different  

Also, it can zoom in: just select the area you wish to zoom in on, and it will zoom in.
